<h1 class = "sweb"> What is Surface Web? </h1>
<font size = 4>
<p> Sites on the surface web (or open web) are those visible to average users without the use of Tor or any other special browsers or software. Sites on the surface web are also indexable and can be easily found using search engines. Although the surface web is made up of many of the most popular .com, .net, and .org sites, it's estimated that it represents only around 5% of the total content available on the internet, with the rest being found on the deep web or dark web. In a classic example, the surface web can be imagined as the tip of a large iceberg whose bulk remains hidden just under the surface. </p> </font>
<h1 id = "dweb"> What is Deep Web? </h1>
<font size = 4>
<ul>
<li>The deep web refers to parts of the internet not fully accessible through standard search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing. </li>
<li> The deep web gives users access to far more information than would otherwise be available on the internet, and it also increases privacy. </li>
<li> Perhaps the most serious criticism of the deep web is that it undermines the openness and equality of the internet. </li> 
<li> The deep web is mainly made up for the work of military, government officials and other officials. </li> </ul> </font> 
<h1 class = "dweb"> What is Dark Web? </h1> 
<font size = 4>
<p> The dark web is like the internet's mysterious basement. It's a part of the World Wide Web that is intentionally hidden and inaccessible through standard web browsers. To access the dark web, you need special tools like Tor, which allows users to browse anonymously. It's often associated with privacy and anonymity, but it also has a reputation for hosting illicit activities such as illegal marketplaces, hacking forums, and more. Keep in mind that not everything on the dark web is nefarious; it also provides a platform for whistleblowers and activists to communicate safely. Always proceed with caution, though! </p> </font> <br>
